Challenge 1 : MySQL Setup and Basic Commands
    CREATE DATABASE schoolDB; --> to create a new database
    USE schoolDB; --> to switch to the schoolDB 
    SHOW DATABASES; --> to ensure schoolDB has been created


Challenge 2 : Using and Displaying Tables
    CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name varchar(255),
    last_name varchar(255),
    subject varchar(255)
    );
    Select * from teachers --> to show my table
    DESCRIBE teachers;


Challenge 3 : Basic SELECT Statements
    Select * from teachers --> to show my table
    SELECT first_name, subject from teachers; --> to retrieve only first_name and subject from the table


Challenge 4 : Exploring JOIN Operations
a.  SELECT teachers.first_name, students.first_name
    FROM teachers
    INNER JOIN students ON teachers.id = students.teacher_id;

b.  SELECT * from students
    LEFT JOIN teachers ON teachers.id=students.teacher_id;

c.  SELECT teachers.first_name, teachers.last_name, teachers.id, students.first_name
    FROM teachers
    RIGHT JOIN students
    ON teachers.id = students.teacher_id;

d.  SELECT *
    FROM students
    FULL JOIN teachers
    ON teachers.id = students.teacher_id;
